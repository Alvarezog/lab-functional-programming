    "Now we want to enhance the `get_bow_from_docs` function so that it will work with HTML webpages. In HTML, there are a lot of messy codes such as HTML tags, Javascripts, [unicodes](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_misc_symbols.asp) that will mess up your bag of words. We need to clean up those junk before generating BoW.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, what you will do is to define several new functions each of which is specialized to clean up the HTML codes in one aspect. For instance, you can have a `strip_html_tags` function to remove all HTML tags, a `remove_punctuation` function to remove all punctuation, a `to_lower_case` function to convert string to lowercase, and a `remove_unicode` function to remove all unicodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in your `get_bow_from_doc` function, you will call each of those functions you created to clean up the HTML before you generate the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Please use Python string operations and regular expression only in this lab. Do not use extra libraries such as `beautifulsoup` because otherwise you loose the purpose of practicing."

highly recommend it to anyone looking to expand their skills or technological knowledge base i had an allaround wonderful learning experience you dont need to have much computer knowledge going into it because each class has multiple teaching assistants who will be there to help if you fall behind or are struggling to keep up my class had  exceptional tas manuel colby and adrian who constantly were able to provide assistance when i ran into trouble had bugs or just got lost they were always nice patient and willing to go the extra mile just to make sure i really understood deeply what we were learning including coming in extra early on the weekends and spending one on one time with me in front of the whiteboard to go over each aspect of what we were learning in detail i was really impressed with and grateful for each of them br', 'br', 'i was also very impressed with the professor alan he is an extremely knowledgeable person with a natural aptitude for teaching always patient courteous and welcoming of questions feedback and taking time to ask us if we all understood or were running into any problems what really impressed me most about alan is how he would take a little bit of time at the start of each class to go beyond the curriculum and to challenge us with computer science coding challenges to prepare us to think like computer scientists and get us ready for the types of questions we would likely see in a coding interview and explain the different ways to approach the problems and how to think about them in terms of time complexity or memory management it was well beyond what i expected from a web development course and i found these lessons particularly rewarding alan has a knack for breaking down complex and abstract concepts into digestible bits and getting the class comfortable enough to try and collectively attempt a solution protip always volunteer to try and solve the problems he presents i noticed the students brave enough to attempt these problems retained information better and walked away with a more solid understanding if he gives you the marker get up there and give it your best effort go home and research the concepts further just do it  get a whiteboard for your house and write important concepts objectives goals and problem examples from class this will force your brain to reconcile this new information on a daily basis you will almost certainly see these types of coding challenges in job interviews and theyre abstract and frustrating if you are not preparedbr', 'br', 'after graduation youll be counseled by brito your career counselor who is also a very cool downtoearth and knowledgeable person he has some real wisdom to share about the interviewing process how to construct your resume and specifically tells you to reach out to him before accepting any job offers i am really impressed with his insight and willingness to be supportive helpful and make sure you land a good starting job well after graduation br',
